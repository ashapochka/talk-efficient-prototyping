# Challenge

## Starting Project for Client

1. Make architectural decisions
2. Estimate effort, schedule, budget
3. Start project implementation

## Starting Risky Project for Client

1. Make architectural decisions
2. **Prototype risky assumptions**
3. **Revise or confirm decisions**
4. Estimate effort, schedule, budget
5. Start project implementation

## What Clients Want

- Peace of Mind
- Bang for The Buck
- Feel in Control

## What's The Challenge

Time's short, there are lots of moving parts and unknowns, 
still the implemented system *must* run at the end of the day.

# Prototype Development Life Cycle

## Team

- Small: 1 to 5 people
- Technical Experts, Productive, Communicators, Self-structured

## Process

- Project duration: 3 to 6 weeks
- Regular team sync-ups and ad-hoc communication
    - But do not waste hours everyday (time is short, remember)
- Weekly or semi-weekly meetings with client
- Keep scope in control
- No Big Bang - Iterative Delivery

# Technology for Prototyping

## Operations

- Counter-intuitive: spend time to script and automate operations
- Continuous Integration
- Use Git, collaborative editing for documents and status tracking
    - Google Drive, Dropbox, Office 365
    - Better still Markdown and similar document formats right in the repository


## Environment

- Quick provisioning and de-provisioning of resources is a King
- Amazon AWS or similar Cloud environment rules:
    - API to script and automate (reproducible!)
    - Relatively reliable
    - Use available services when possible instead of manual installation

## Deployment

Docker

## Languages, Frameworks, COTS

Spring Boot, Trial Licenses

# End of Story

# Throw Away
